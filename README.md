# fileInput
Write a C++ program that is given a file name as a command line argument.  Open the file and read it. At the end of the file, print out:  LINES: lc WORDS: wc CHARS: cc DIGITS: dc  Where lc is the number of lines, wc is the number of words, cc is the number of characters, and dc is the number of digit characters, 0-9.  If no file name is provided, the program should use the standard input instead of a file.  If the file cannot be opened, print "CANNOT OPEN " followed by a space and the filename, and stop.  The program should ignore any extra command line arguments that are provided after the file name.
